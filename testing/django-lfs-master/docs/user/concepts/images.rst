Overview
========

LFS provides two kinds of images: product images and global images.

Product images
==============

Product images managed within the :ref:`images tab <products_management_images>`
of a product and are attached to a single product. They are displayed
automatically within the detail view of the product and the first image also
within the category overview view.

Global images
==============

Global images are managed on a :doc:`central place
</user/management/shop/images>` and can be easily embedded within any :term:`WYSIWYG`
text field within LFS (e.g. within a :doc:`page </user/concepts/pages>`).

To do that one just  have to click on the image icon of the :term:`WYSIWYG`
editor (see below), select the image in question, adapt the class and size of
the image and click on the ``insert image`` button.
