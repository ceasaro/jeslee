Actions

This section describes the concepts of actions.

Overview
========

Actions are used to place links on several locations within the shop. They
belong to exactly one action group and the action group decides the location the
actions are displayed within the shop. LFS ships with two action groups, the
tabs, which constitutes the horizontal menu bar and the footer. Developers can
easily :ref:`add more action groups   <how_to_add_own_action_groups>`.

Examples
========

Actions enables the shop owner to link to arbitrary categories, products,
information pages or even external web sites.
