This section describes the reviews of LFS.

Overview
========

Shop customers can review the products.

A review consists of a score of 1-5 stars and an arbitrary text. The average
rating for a product is calculated automatically and displayed within the
product view and the :ref:`average rating portlet
<portlets_concepts_average_rating>`.

Logged in customers can review a product only once, anonymous customers just
once in a session.

Shop administrators can influence the way reviews are handled, e.g. whether
reviews are moderated or which fields are required. See :ref:`settings
<settings_reviews>` for more.

Shop owners can send :ref:`rating mails <rating_mails_management>` to shop
customers in order to ask them to rate the products thy bought.
