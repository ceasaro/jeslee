This section describes the concept of local properties.

Overview
========

Local properties are added to single products. They are a convenient way to
create single variants for a :ref:`product with variants
<products_concepts_product_with_variants>`. In contrary to :doc:`global
properties </user/concepts/properties>` they can not be used to create
:ref:`configurable products <products_concepts_configurable_product>`, create
filters or to display several informations on a product.
